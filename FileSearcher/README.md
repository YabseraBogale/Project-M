How hard can it be

the project went all with all the all the langauge.

1) C-Sharp

this was good to do but the language is not spport in linux, and slow and i am not going to use it personally
Note: the code base for it have benn removed

2) C++ 

this have documentation problem need to shift through alot of data. but speed is amazing

3) golang
