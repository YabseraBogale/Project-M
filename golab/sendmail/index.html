  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>
    As a computer science student with hands-on experience in full-stack development
    and UI/UX design, I bring a solid foundation in building and optimizing web
    platforms. My internship experience at Fri-el Ethiopia allowed me to work on real-
    world projects, where I developed server-side functionality using python and
    flask, managed databases with postgress, and contributed to frontend design
    and debugging.<br> My proficiency with the LAMP stack, coupled with my skills in
    RESTful API design, database management makes me a strong fit for roles that require both technical expertise and a
    collaborative
    approach. I am eager to contribute to innovative projects and continue growing as a software developer.
