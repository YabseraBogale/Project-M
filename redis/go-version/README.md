What is Redis ?
Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) is an open-source, in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker. It is known for its high performance, low latency, and flexibility, making it a popular choice in many applications requiring quick data access.
Key Features of Redis:

    In-Memory Storage:
        Stores data primarily in memory, resulting in fast read/write operations.
        Can persist data to disk for backup or recovery.

    Data Structures:
        Supports various data types, including:
            Strings
            Lists
            Sets
            Sorted Sets
            Hashes
            Bitmaps
            Streams
            Geospatial indexes

    Use Cases:
        Caching: To store frequently accessed data for fast retrieval.
        Session Management: To manage user sessions in web applications.
        Pub/Sub Messaging: For real-time communication and event streaming.
        Queue Management: To implement queues with features like delayed processing.
        Leaderboard Systems: Using sorted sets for ranking data.
        Data Analysis: Storing and querying real-time analytics.

    Performance:
        Handles millions of requests per second with sub-millisecond latency.

    Persistence:
        Offers two persistence options:
            RDB (Redis Database Backup): Periodic snapshots of the dataset.
            AOF (Append-Only File): Logs every write operation to enable point-in-time recovery.

    Cluster Support:
        Redis can be configured to work as a cluster, allowing horizontal scaling and data sharding.

    Lightweight:
        Minimal overhead, which ensures efficient resource usage.

Commonly Used In:

    Web applications
    Gaming leaderboards
    IoT platforms
    Real-time analytics dashboards
    Machine learning pipelines
