      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        As a computer science student with hands-on experience in full-stack development
        and UI/UX design, I bring a solid foundation in building and optimizing web
        platforms. My internship experience at Fri-el Ethiopia allowed me to work on real-
        world projects, where I developed server-side functionality using python and
        flask, managed databases with postgress, and contributed to frontend design
        and debugging.<br> My proficiency with the LAMP stack, coupled with my skills in
        RESTful API design, database management makes me a strong fit for roles that require both technical expertise
        and a
        collaborative
        approach. I am eager to contribute to innovative projects and continue growing as a software developer.
