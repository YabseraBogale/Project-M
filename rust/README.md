# Question on Rust

what I know and tested so far
    1. it has very good package manager.
    2. most of the users of use cargo to build and run project and this have created problem seen in node and python too much dependency. 
    3. it is very antiold hardware it uses to much resource when building project making it to use.
    4. compile time takes a long time but that is prespective b/c there are ways around this. 
    5. very easy to use in problems that have been solved prevously. 
    6. It is growing. and the problem to trying to save is safety and performance is good. 

The good parts are 1,5,6
The bad parts are 2,3,4


Things to check how far can some on go without external libary
